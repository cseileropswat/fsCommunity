# fsCommunityUtils

This repo will be home to a small collection of scripts (currently, only python) that can be used to interact with the community service at www.filescan.io or FileScan.IO standalone instances. In addition, POC samples will be collected that outline unique features of the service.

Generating an API key is easy and free. Just visit your settings page: https://www.filescan.io/users/profile
